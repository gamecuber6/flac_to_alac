# FLAC to ALAC 

a simple windows batch script based on ffmpeg to convert a bunch of flac files from a single folder to m4a using apple's proprietary lossless codec needed for lossless audio playback on ipods in one go

for it to work a copy of ffmpeg.exe must be placed in the same directory as the script itself resides (so there is no need to install ffmpeg to the system PATH)
